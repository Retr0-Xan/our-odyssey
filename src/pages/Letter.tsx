      content: `It's crazy to think it's already been a year since we've been together. It feels as if I've known you much longer. (Technically yes, but you know what I meanüòâ).
      Giving Fortnite another chance was one of the best decisions I've ever made because it led me to you.

      I honestly sometimes sit to think about how different my life would be if I hadn't met you. You have brought so much joy, love, and light into my life. And I'm so grateful to God for bringing you into my life. He really cooked with this one

I know we've had our ups and downs, but every moment with you has been worth it. I don't know about you, but I feel like I've grown so much as a person since we've been together. You've challenged me to be better. You genuinely get stressed over me (sorry wai), and I love that you care so much, and I am so grateful for that.I love how we can talk about anything and everything, and how we can be ourselves together.

I know I'm not an easy person, and I understand that I can't give you everything now, but I promise to keep working on myself for you (and for me obviously, don't worry). You are my rock, my confidant, my best friend. 
  
  

You are my greatest adventure, my safest harbor, my most cherished dream come true. Thank you for loving me, for choosing me, for being exactly who you are.

Forever and always yours,
With all my love ‚ù§Ô∏è`

      content: `Your love is like sunlight breaking through clouds after a storm‚Äîwarm, healing, and absolutely essential to my existence. You love with your whole heart, holding nothing back, and that courage inspires me every single day.

I love how you laugh at my terrible jokes, how you sing in the shower when you think I can't hear, how you scrunch your nose when you're concentrating. I love your passion for the things you care about, your kindness to strangers, your unwavering loyalty to the people you love.

You've taught me that love isn't just a feeling‚Äîit's a choice we make every day. And every morning, I wake up choosing you, choosing us, choosing this beautiful life we're building together.

The way you see the world has changed how I see it too. Through your eyes, I've discovered beauty in places I never looked before, found joy in moments I might have overlooked, and learned that the smallest gestures can carry the deepest meaning.`
